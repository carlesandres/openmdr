# Repository Notes

Notes for AI assistants (and humans) working in this repo. This file is
about *the moves*, not the design — read `DESIGN.md` for what the project
is and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the human-contributor view.

## Where to read first

- `DESIGN.md` — scope, non-goals (§3), deferred features (§5.3), reserved
  keys (§7.3), v2 gates (§10), **deferred patterns with triggers (§12)**.
  Always check §12 before re-introducing a pattern that "feels missing" —
  there is probably a documented reason it isn't there yet.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — local loop, testing, commit/PR shape, release flow.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — what's queued under `[Unreleased]`. New work appends
  here; release time moves it under a dated heading.

## Conventions worth knowing

- Format: **tabs, no semicolons, 100-col, trailing commas** (see
  `.oxfmtrc.json`). `bun run format` writes; CI gates on
  `format:check`.
- Test root: `bunfig.toml` pins `[test] root = "test"` so `bun test`
  doesn't crawl `reference/`.
- `TODO(revisit: <topic>)` markers in source point back at
  `DESIGN.md` §12. `grep -r 'TODO(revisit:' src/` lists them.
- Bindings live in `src/keymap/browser.ts` as data. Adding a key:
  append a `KeyBinding`, the `?` overlay picks it up. Reserved keys
  (`/`, `e`, `o`, `r`) are off-limits in v1.
- Themes are typed `ColorPalette` values (`src/theme/types.ts`)
  consumed via the mutable singleton `colors`. Pattern lifted from
  ghui at small scale; do not introduce React Context for theme.

## Headless test pattern

`testRender` + `captureCharFrame` + `mockInput` (see
`test/spike.test.tsx`). When asserting on `<markdown>` body content,
prefer stable surfaces (border titles, sidebar rows) — the markdown
body has first-frame quirks under headless render. Some keys (Escape)
need a ~60ms wait after press for opentui's parser to disambiguate
`\x1b`.

For deeper output validation (styled spans, async highlight pipelines,
intermediate frames) use `captureSpans()`, `renderer.idle()`,
`MockTreeSitterClient`, and `TestRecorder` — all from
`@opentui/core/testing`. Worked example:
`test/markdown-codeblock.test.tsx`. Full notes in
`CONTRIBUTING.md` under "Validating rendered output deeper than
text". Don't reach for PTY-based testing — `captureSpans` covers
every case we have today.

If `bun dev` and `bun run dev` seem to differ, check for stale watcher
processes before changing renderer code. Both resolve to the `dev`
script, but orphaned `bun --watch src/index.tsx ...` processes can keep
showing old behavior. Use `ps ... | rg 'bun (run )?dev|bun --watch
src/index.tsx|src/index.tsx'` and `lsof -a -p <pid> -d cwd` to verify.

For fenced code blocks, rely on opentui's built-in `<markdown>` renderer
and keep `test/markdown-codeblock.test.tsx` covering tagged fences. Do
not replace the markdown renderer or reintroduce a broad `renderNode`
override unless DESIGN.md §12's custom-renderer trigger has fired.

## Local commands

```bash
bun run dev <path>      # watch + run from source
bun test                # 75 tests, all headless
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun run format
bun run format:check
bun run dev/bench-markdown.ts <dir>   # microbench
npm pack --dry-run      # show exactly what would land on npm
```

## Release process

Release-event-driven. Modeled on ghui, adapted for this repo's
branch protection (direct commits to `main` are blocked, every change
goes through a PR).

1. Move `[Unreleased]` items in `CHANGELOG.md` under a new
   `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` heading; update the link refs at the
   bottom of the file.
2. Bump `version` in `package.json`.
3. From `main`, branch off (`git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z`),
   commit (`chore: release vX.Y.Z`) — do **not** amend earlier
   commits — and push the branch.
4. Open a PR into `main` titled `chore: release vX.Y.Z`. Wait for
   CI to be green (typecheck + lint + format:check + test +
   `npm pack --dry-run`). Merge.
5. Pull `main` locally so the release commit is at `origin/main`'s
   tip:

   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
   ```

6. Create a GitHub release at tag `vX.Y.Z` (auto-generated notes
   are fine; you can curate before publishing):

   ```bash
   gh release create vX.Y.Z --target main --title "vX.Y.Z" \
     --generate-notes
   ```

7. The `release: published` event fires
   `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, which:
   - runs `bun run typecheck`,
   - asserts `v${package.version}` matches `${GITHUB_REF_NAME}`,
   - runs `npm pack --dry-run`,
   - runs `npm publish` (Trusted Publisher / OIDC; no `NPM_TOKEN`).

   If the `npm` GitHub environment has required reviewers, the
   publish job pauses at "Waiting for reviewer" — approve via the
   run's web page or `gh run view <id> --web`.

8. Watch and verify:

   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow publish.yml --limit 3
   gh run watch
   npm view @carlesandres/house version    # should equal X.Y.Z
   ```

There is no compiled binary, no Homebrew tap yet — both tracked as
GitHub issues. Don't add an `NPM_TOKEN`-style secret; the npm-side
config uses Trusted Publisher with owner `carlesandres`, repo
`house`, workflow `publish.yml`, environment `npm`.

## Things that are *not* the right move

- Re-introducing a deferred pattern (DESIGN.md §12) without checking
  whether its trigger has fired.
- Adding a feature on the deferred list (§5.3) without an issue
  agreeing to do it now.
- Binding a reserved key (§7.3) — break it and v2 work has to
  re-train muscle memory.
- Adding `// TODO`s without the `(revisit: <topic>)` form when they
  pair with a §12 entry.
- Compiling to a standalone binary as part of the release flow. We
  ship JS source via npm; the user brings Bun. Binary distribution is
  a future option tracked as a GH issue, not a near-term move.
- Amending or force-pushing commits on `main`.

## Communication

All project communication happens in **GitHub issues**. There is no
Discussions tab, no chat. If something feels ambiguous, open an
issue.
